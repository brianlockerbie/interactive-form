## Interactive Form

This is the third of ten projects for the 🏡 Treehouse TechDegree Full Stack JavaScript.

I created an app that manipulates a registration form and validates the users input. It gives different error messages when the page is submited with invalid inputs. This project uses JavaScript and form validation using regular expressions to enhance an interactive registration form.
